Submitting abstract to Quebect Conference to be able to display a poster there.

AFTER:

File parsing:
    - Fixed up the mult-line parser to work a project (the actual project file names are hashed to allow for multiple entires to compare the entries)
    - Added some counts to count documentation
    - stored code and documentation strings collected while parsing.

Next steps:
    1. Search throught commit message and title for 'fix', 'bug', 'feature'...
    2. Link the code to the comments
