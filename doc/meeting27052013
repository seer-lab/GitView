1. Query/Visualize:
    - Project,
    - Package,

    - Unit
2. Gather data from multiple files projects
3. Data collection
    - Code
    - Commit Info
    - Comment on commits
    - grep files for
        - bug
        - feature
        - fix...
4. Code metrics
    - Complexity.

Submitting abstract to Quebec Conference to be able to display a poster there.

AFTER:

File parsing:
    - Fixed up the mult-line parser to work a project (the actual project file names are hashed to allow for multiple entires to compare the entries)
    - Added some counts to count documentation
    - stored code and documentation strings collected while parsing.

Next steps:
    1. Search through commit message and title for 'fix', 'bug', 'feature'...
    2. Link the code to the comments
        1. Work on identifying blocks in the source code.
            - Depending on the comment type will change what body needs to be taken in.
