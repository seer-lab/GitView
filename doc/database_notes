Need to decide whether I want to keep the git data raw, or if I want to parse it before it is stored

I would like to know:
	- # lines of code added
	- # lines of code deleted
	- # lines of documentation added
	- # lines of documentation deleted

4 types of documentation (in file) that im intrested in
	- File documentation
	- Class documentation (sometimes the same as the previous)
	- Method/Function documentation
	- In line documentation

File
	- Documentation
	- Classes
		- Class
			- Documentation
			- Inline Documentation (might group this with instance variables)
			- Instance Variables 
			- Methods
				- Method
					- Documentation
					- Inline Documentation
					- Code

Documentation would be (and inline documentation)
	- Additions
	- Deletions

Code would be (and instance variables)
	- Additions
	- Deletions

* Need to handle file "inline" comments which could be just added to the file's documentation
